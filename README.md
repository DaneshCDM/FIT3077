## Game Instructions
**Updated to: Sprint Two Implementation**

***Game Objective:** <br>
The game ends and you are the WINNER when you have reduced your opponent to only
two (2) tokens or when the opponent can no longer make any valid moves on the board. <br>
This is achieved by trying to create "mills" (three (3) tokens in a row) to remove the opponents tokens from the board
while preventing the opponent from doing the same.*

**Initial Phase:** <br>
Each player takes turns placing nine (9) of their own respective tokens on the board. <br>
Players can only place their tokens on vacant / empty positions on the board. <br>
The goal is to position your tokens well so that it sets you up for success in the upcoming phases. <br>
*Click a vacant location on the board when the display shows it is your turn*
1. Player 1 (White) places a token
2. Player 2 (Black) places a token
3. The cycle repeats until both players have nine (9) tokens each on the board

**Mid-Game Phase** <br>
Players take turns moving their tokens along the lines on the board.
When a player forms a mill (three (3) tokens in a row), he/she removes one of the opponent's tokens from the board. <br>
The Mid-Game Phase ends when a player is reduced to only three (3) tokens on the board <br>
